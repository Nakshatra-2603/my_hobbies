            <h3>Cubing</h3>
            <p>Cubing is an indoor game which involves a lot of thinking and skills. I have been cubing since 2-3 years and I can solve 8 types of cubes. Many people give up saying that it's too hard. If you really want to learn how to solve a cube, all that you need is focus and efforts and in no time you will learn how to solves cubes!</p>

            <h3>3x3:</h3>
            <p>3x3 Rubik's cube was the first rubik's cube that was created. It is the original rubik's cube. Almost all the cubes are based on the 3x3, in shape as well as in the solving method.</p>

            <h3>Megaminx:</h3>
            <p>Megaminx is a cube with 12 sides (the double of a normal cube). Though it looks tough to solve, if you know how to solve a 3x3, you can solve this giant monster.</p>
